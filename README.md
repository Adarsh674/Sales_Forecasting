The utilization of machine learning techniques in sales forecasting has gained significant traction across various industries, offering a data-driven approach to predict future sales trends and patterns. In this project, we delve into the application of machine learning in sales forecasting specifically within the transportation sector, encompassing a wide array of vehicles such as motorcycles, classic cars, vintage cars, buses, trains, trucks, planes, and ships. By leveraging historical sales data, our objective is to develop predictive models that can aid businesses in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business planning processes.
